**\[Description\]** <br/>
&#8195;This branch is created for the first homework, which requires us to reproduce the work shown in [Probabilistic Matrix Factorization, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Andriy Mnih, 2007](http://www.utstat.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/nips_draft2.pdf).
&#8195;I am not gonna show all the details in this markdown file, instead, **I have already written a report (mainly for my latter usage) and put it under the "report" directory**. 

<br/>
<br/>

**\[How to reproduce my homework\]** <br/>
1. Download my branch and unzip the .zip package.
2. Open the file "PMF.py" and click the "run" bottom on your Python interpretor interface.
> Note that *matplotlib*, *numpy* modules are required.
